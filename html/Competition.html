		  <li class="w3-padding"><font size="5"><b> Propulsion Sub-Team </b></font><p><font size="3"> This year, the Propulsion team has been hard at  work  ironing  out  flaws  in  our  designs  and  procedures. We started with the small Phobos-1  engine  that  had  been  machined  last  year,  and  managed  several  hot-fire  tests  with  it.  Although  the  data  was  inaccurate  due  to  incomplete  fuel  burning,  we  learned  a  lot  about  fuel  and  graphite  manufacturing  that  we fully expect to be applicable to Phobos-2 and -3.  We  also  finished  designing  Phobos-2 and  the  larger  test  stand,  Andromeda  Sr.,  although  fabrication  was  halted  due  to  the  shutdown.  Currently,  we  are  redesigning  the  Phobos-3 with the intent of making it as light as possible while still being able to withstand the chamber pressure, as well as learning a lot about how to accurately run finite element analysis on the system as a whole. </font></p></li>
		  <li class="w3-padding"><font size="5"><b> Structures Sub-Team </b></font><p><font size="3"> The Structures team  has  been  working  on  the  design  of  the  rocket  airframe,  aerodynamic  analysis, and development of composites manufacturing techniques that will be used to build the main tube of the rocket. We have narrowed down our design to use a vacuum-bagged unidirectional carbon fiber layup for the main tubes, and have built our  first  test  tube  to  be  tested  in  Olin’s  Material  Science  laboratory  when we return to campus. We designed a fiberglass nose cone with a Von Karman profile in order to allow RF transparency and minimal transonic drag. We are currently designing a balsa wood and carbon fiber composite fin which uses a supercritical, symmetrical airfoil. The carbon  skin  of  each  fin  will  flare  into  the  body  tube  to  reduce  interference  drag.  We  are  currently  designing  a  telescoping  body  tube coupler to interact with the recovery system. Our next steps are to complete a full 3D model of the rocket including each subsystem in  order  to  reduce  design  interference,  and  to  begin  finite  element analysis on each portion of the rocket to make sure it can withstand the high loads it will experience in flight. </font></p></li>
		  <li class="w3-padding"><font size="5"><b> Avionics Sub-Team </b></font><p><font size="3"> Over the 2019-2020 academic year, the Avionics team has observed a huge growth in team size - we now have 10 total members, up from 5,  working  on  designing  the  main  flight  computer,  sensing,  apogee  detection,   onboard   recovery   system,   the   battery   management   system,  and  the  electro-mechanical  integration  of  the  electronic  hardware  spatially  inside  of  the  rocket.  We  have  fabricated  and  tested the main flight computer which has a microcontroller board, a long-range radio module, an altimeter, an accelerometer, and a GPS measurement  unit  all  working  together  to  track  in-flight  motion.  The  program  that  runs  on  this  printed  circuit  board  is  currently  under  testing and should be up and running as soon as the team is able to return  to  Olin’s  campus.  The  avionics  system  has  been  designed  to  activate  a  series  of  solenoids  and heat  up  a  nichrome  wire  system  which  is  responsible  for  parachute  deployment  as  the  rocket  hits apogee. The battery management system will serve the power needs for all of the avionics’ electronics, along with a backup battery pack as a power fail-safe. Quite recently, we have appointed  a  team  for  Research and Development  in  avionics -  the  members  will  be  looking  at  ways  to  better  our  current system in order to work more reliably, as well as to design more learning opportunities for  future  members.  Our  year-end  goals  include  testing  the  remaining  avionics  systems  (recovery and battery management) and the flight computer software for early edge-case detection. We have also begun documentation for this past year and given initial thoughts on the timeline and budget goals for the upcoming academic year. </font></p></li>
		  <li class="w3-padding"><font size="5"><b> Recovery Sub-Team </b></font><p><font size="3"> The recovery team has been working on a prototype of the Phoenix III recovery system. We have moved to using a pressurized air tank, a solenoid and a pneumatic piston to separate the rocket and deploy the drogue chute. The drogue chute will slow down the rocket from apogee to 1500ft and then we are going to deploy the main parachute. The main parachute will be restrained inside the rocket with a nylon cord and will be deployed byburning through the cord using a nichrome wire. After building a prototype we successfully proved that the piston is strong enough to break through the pins holding the rocket together, and that the nichrome wire can burn the nylon cord. Our next step is to redesign some aspects of the system and machine the flight hardware. We are looking forward to doing drop tests next semester and flying the system in competition! </font></p></li>
